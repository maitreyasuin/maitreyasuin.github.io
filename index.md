I am working as a Senior Researcher, AI at Samsung AI Center Toronto. Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the **[AIEM Lab, Johns Hopkins University](https://aiem.jhu.edu/)**. I was advised by **[Prof. Rama Chellappa](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/rama-chellappa/)** specializing in topics related to Computer Vision. Previously, I completed my MS and PhD at **[Image Processing and Computer Vision Lab, IIT Madras](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ipcvlab/)** under the supervision of **[Prof. A. N. Rajagopalan](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/raju/)**. I received my Bachelor's Degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from **[Institute of Engineering and Management, Kolkata](http://iem.edu.in/)**. My research expertise lies in the domains of computer vision and machine learning, with a specific focus on diffusion models, image processing pipeline in camera, image and video restoration, image and face recognition/detection. My recent work involved leveraging diffusion models for tasks such as blind face restoration, emphasizing the recovery of underlying identity. I have also worked on face detection, enhancement, and recognition from low-quality videos, few shot personalizations using diffusion models with a focus on perceptual quality and speed. During my PhD, I focused on building adaptive neural networks for handling spatially and temporally varying tasks, using efficient non-local attention and spatially varying filtering modules, for inpainting, and spatially-varying restoration of images/videos suffering from blur, low-resolution, rain, haze, etc.
