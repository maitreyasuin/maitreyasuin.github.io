I am a postdoctoral researcher in the **[AIEM Lab, Johns Hopkins University](https://aiem.jhu.edu/)**. I am advised by **[Prof. Rama Chellappa](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/rama-chellappa/)** specializing on topics related to Computer Vision. Previously, I completed my MS and PhD at **[Image Processing and Computer Vision Lab, IIT Madras](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ipcvlab/)** under the supervision of **[Prof. A. N. Rajagopalan](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/raju/)**. I received my Bachelor's Degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from **[Institute of Engineering and Management, Kolkata](http://iem.edu.in/)**. My research lies at the intersection of Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Deep Reinforcement Learning. I have worked toward building adaptive neural networks for handling spatially and temporally varying tasks. My recent works have focused on image and video enhancement using efficient non-local attention modules, image inpainting, and spatially-varying restoration of images suffering from blur, low-resolution, rain, haze, etc. I have also worked on a few vision-and-language problems, such as dense video captioning from a long video with multiple temporal events.
